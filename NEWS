===== 1.0.1 (Unreleased)
    - Display the HTTP status code in the response pane.
    - Run JSON output through std.json for pretty printing to avoid JSON responses being put on one line because the
      server sent it that way.
    - Fixed basic authentication wrongly generating the 'Authentication' header instead of the 'Authorization' header as
      well as not prefixing 'Basic' to the value.

===== 1.0.0 (5 July 2015)
    - Initial release.
